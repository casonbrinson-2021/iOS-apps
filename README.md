# iOS-apps

# About
A collection of functional iOS apps created by Gregory Cason Brinson

Each file is in .zip due to the size of each project

All projects were made using a virtual Macintosh machine provided by Virginia Tech. Due to this I do not currently have any screenshots of the applications running.
